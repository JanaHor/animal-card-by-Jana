            <p class="description">Lions are large felines that are traditionally depicted as the "king of the jungle." Male lions are generally larger than females and have a distinctive mane of hair around their heads. The mane's function is to make the male look more impressive
                to females and more intimidating to other males. The mane also protects the male's neck during fights over territory or mating rights.</p>
